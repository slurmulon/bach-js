> :musical_score: Bach music notation parser for JS
---

`bach` is a notation for representing musical tracks with a focus on human readability.

You can find detailed information on the `bach` notation by visiting the [repository home page](https://github.com/slurmulon/bach).

This library parses [bach.json](https://github.com/slurmulon/bach-json-schema) data and establishes the semantics.

It is not ready for production and should be considered experimental.
